Odin html/css project
http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css

	The goal of this project was to replicate the standard google homepage(as it was 12/20/16) with the basic css/html
skills i have learned so far from the odin project's website. In addition i practiced using git bash and uploaded my
project to my github profile.

	Uploaded my first draft with nearly everything in its place. I'm having trouble with the sign in button. I know it's
not an actual image but i haven't been able to get it to look right. Using a placeholder image for the meantime(which also doesn't look
quite right either). Need to finish the buttons and the text input form.
